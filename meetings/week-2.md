We will meet either or both Kevins on Wednesdays at 8pm at Courtyard Study Lounge unless agreed upon otherwise. 

If unavailable for face to face, we will keep in contact with the sponsors through email or meet using Google Hangout.

## Project goals

Our goal this quarter is to produce a working prototype of the mobile application. Users will be able to add their own cards to a communal deck, and view all the cards in that deck. 

## Other notes

Kevin L. will be starting in the hospital in 2 months, which will limit his availability.
