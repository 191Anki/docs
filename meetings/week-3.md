## Time and place

Courtyard Study Lounge, April 16th, 8pm.

## Business case changes

+ Shifted focus from mobile app development to web-based development.
+ Specified deliverables and expectations of the systemâ€™s functionality. 

## Requirements document changes

Instead of only changing the Anki applications, we will be modifying the Anki desktop code slightly, and then creating a website that will be able to host all of the shared decks, allow users to search for decks, put multiple similar decks into one, and allow students to contribute to decks as well as download them. As much as possible the website will use similar Anki logic for the filters. The website interface plans to give users information like what cards exist in which deck, limited universal tagging privileges, and who has made what edits to each card/deck.

## Project development and delivery timeline

+Have initial sharing and website capabilities functional by August
+Have website up and running by Week 10
+Have consolidated decks and run bug testing over summer
+Start coding by the end of Week 5
