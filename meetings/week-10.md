## <i>(6/4 Email Thread)</i>
<b>Team Anki:</b><br>
Hello,<br><br>
We are excited to say that we have a working website right now. I have included screenshots below of what the website looks like in this initial stage. We would love any feedback from you on what you like or dislike about it. We are also writing to remind you that we are presenting on Monday at 3:40pm. This presentation will be located in ICS 193. We can meet you in front of the ICS building in the area between the Engineering Tower and ICS 10 minutes before the presentation. I have also included a preliminary outline of our presentation.<br><br>
Looking forward to seeing you and showing you what we have worked on.<br><br>
<b>Kevin L.:</b><br>
Looks great. You should be proud of your efforts. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make the meeting. I am in call until 10p. Let me know how it goes.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Kevin<br><br>
<b>Kevin S.:</b><br>
Great! Thanks for the update!<br><br>
In the downloads section of the mock up, is the list below a representations of where the uploaded decks would be? Also, do we have a preview of the user view of the categories for the decks?<br><br>
Monday at 3:40 sounds good. See you there and thanks for your hard work!<br><br>
<b>Team Anki:</b><br><br>
Hi Kevin!<br><br>
Yes, the list would show the decks that have been uploaded. This is not the final design layout though as it will change as the website develops.<br><br>
A sorting function of the decks and cards have not been implemented
yet, so the view of categories hasn't been implemented yet. This is
still being worked on and will be implemented over the summer. So far,
the website has basic upload/download capabilities and a login/reigster
system.<br><br>
