## Time and Place

Wednesdays 5/21 and 5/28 via email (group emailed sponsors and sponsors responded back)

## Progress Discussion with Sponsors
For weeks 8 and 9 our group did not meet with out sponsors because we've just been working on code. Since it took us awhile to setup our development environment and get working code up on the website, we chose not to physically meet with our sponsors and instead just updated them both weeks via email. For week 8, our main update for the sponsors was to let them know our progress with our development environment setup. For week 9, we updated our sponsors on our new server, database, and website information, and filled them in on what to expect at our final demo presentation. 

## Next Steps

Based on sponsor responses to the group's emailed updates, our next steps/decisions will be to do the following before the final demo presentation: 
+ Finish the homepage, upload, and download pages of the website.
+ Clean up the page designs and aesthetics.
+ Finish as much as we can for user accounts (login, registration, email verification).

## (5/28 Email)

Hi Kevins,

Here's a quick update on where the team is at:

We've secured a more permanent domain, server, and database (not necessarily set in stone still, but it's a better situation than the ICS temp accounts). The URL is http://www.ankishare.com. None of our code is live yet, but it will be come the final demo. 

For the final demo presentation (Mon. June 9 3:40-4:20pm), we're shooting to have the homepage, upload decks, and download decks pages live and running. 

As for the team's summer plans for the August release, we'll be able to talk about that more and present that to you both during the presentation.

Since the team is mainly focused on coding right now to get our MVP (minimum viable product) done, we won't need to have our regular Wed. 8pm meetings anymore for the rest of the quarter. We will, however, check in with you and give you updates via email for the next two weeks before the final presentation.

Please let us know if you have any questions. We look forward to seeing you both at the final demo!

- Jazmynn, Dillon, Kyla, Vamsi, Wilbur
