## Time and Place

Wednesdays 5/21 and 5/28 via email (group emailed sponsors and sponsors responded back)

## Progress Discussion with Sponsors
For weeks 8 and 9 our group did not meet with out sponsors because we've just been working on code. Since it took us awhile to setup our development environment and get working code up on the website, we chose not to physically meet with our sponsors and instead just updated them both weeks via email. For week 8, our main update for the sponsors was to let them know our progress with our development environment setup. For week 9, we updated our sponsors on our new server, database, and website information, and filled them in on what to expect at our final demo presentation. 

## Next Steps

Based on sponsor responses to the group's emailed updates, our next steps/decisions will be to do the following before the final demo presentation: 
+ Finish the homepage, upload, and download pages of the website.
+ Clean up the page designs and aesthetics.
+ Finish as much as we can for user accounts (login, registration, email verification).
