## Time and Place

## Progress Discussion with Sponsors
Meeting was dedicated to showing sponsors version 2 website mockups and getting their feedback. Overall the sponsors responded positively to the mockups. The feedback we got from them: 1) add more tiers/levels to deck organization 2) add a communal deck for tiers 3 and beyond (course, topic, subtopic) and 3) design the system so that moderators can be implemented once the initial website it setup.

## Next Steps

Based on sponsor feedback and other topics dicussed in the meetings, out next steps/decisions will be: 
++ Create verion 3 mockups to incorporate: 1) new tier design for deck organization and add additional tier levels and 2) communal decks for tiers 3 and beyond.
++ Design and code the website with the intention that a separate moderator interface will be added in the future (whether or not it's during our team's project time).
