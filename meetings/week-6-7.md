## Time and Place

Calit2, 8pm.

## Progress Discussion with Sponsors
Meeting was dedicated to showing sponsors version 2 website mockups and getting their feedback. Overall the sponsors responded positively to the mockups. The feedback we got from them: 1) add more tiers/levels to deck organization 2) add a communal deck for tiers 3 and beyond (course, topic, subtopic) and 3) design the system so that moderators can be implemented once the initial website is setup.

## Next Steps

Based on sponsor feedback and other topics dicussed in the meetings, out next steps/decisions will be: 
+ Create verion 3 mockups to incorporate: 1) new tier design for deck organization and add additional tier levels and 2) communal decks for tiers 3 and beyond.
+ Design and code the website with the intention that a separate moderator interface will be added in the future (whether or not it's during our team's project time).
+ Still need to figure out how to incorporate "informatics report" (user activity log/report) feature on the website. Report should only be accessible to professors, so we need to figure out where to put this feature since it's not intended for the typical user (typical user is a UCI medical student).
