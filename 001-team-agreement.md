## File management

We will use Git, GitHub and Google Docs for file management.

Specifically, we will upload all files in GitHub repositories owned by our organization, "191Anki".

We will create documentation in Google Docs and turn in documentation in the “docs” repository on GitHub.

We will keep code in one repository called “code”. We will add more repositories if needed.

## Miscellaneous

We agree to communicate regularly, even if the news is bad.

At the beginning of every meeting and co-working session we will take 5 minutes to talk about any issues we have encountered since last seeing each other, any progress we have made, and what we feel is high priority for our current meeting.

At the end of every meeting we will take 5 minutes to talk about what we went over during the meeting, and will take notes on any progress we have made, any issues we need to resolve, and any question we have for our client, for Professor Ziv or for Six.

Every person commits to attending scheduled meetings and co-working hours.

We will tell our teammates as early as we can if we can't make a meeting or work session.

We will communicate through GroupMe, Email, Facebook, Google Docs and Google Hangouts as well as in person.

If people say something on the facebook group we will like it to show we have read it and understand it.

If people say something on the GroupMe we will respond that we have read it and understand it.

We agree to volunteer to take on tasks and do them well and on time as best we can.

If we don't know how to do something, we will do our best to figure it out. We will ask for help if we get stuck.
