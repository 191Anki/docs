## What we are building

We are improving the Anki flashcard mobile application. The application currently is used to create, review, and share flashcards but the sharing feature is not entirely user friendly. Our improvements will allow users to share their flashcard decks with one another more efficiently (horizontal integration), and allow the “best” flash-cards to be entered into a central database (vertical integration). The users (students of UCI Medical School) will upload flashcards they have made themselves onto the central database into a shared deck. Users will then be able to view all of the cards within the shared deck. 

Users will also be able to vote on which flash cards are the most useful and have the best definitions. Students will be able to edit cards, and then the edits will be approved by selected moderators. We will be creating an algorithm to sort cards based on the votes for and against the cards, deleting cards with a low enough voting score.

## Why we are building it

Improving the Anki flashcard mobile application will create a more connected learning community within the UCI Medical School students and will improve the application’s user experience.

The Anki mobile application allows users to create personal decks and share them with other Anki users via import and export. The deck sharing feature requires users to manually import and export each flashcard deck to use and edit other’s decks, putting users off from using the sharing feature. Anki flashcard decks are mainly individual, and this causes current students to do a lot of redundant work. If they were all able to add to a shared deck they could spend more time on studying the best definitions, and making cards better, rather than making the cards. UCI Medical School wants to create a community for the students and improving the sharing feature will allow this.
