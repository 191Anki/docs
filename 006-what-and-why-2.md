## What we are building

We are extending the Anki flashcard software by building a web application for sharing cards within the UCI School of Medicine. The Anki application currently is used to create, review, and share flashcards but the sharing feature is not entirely user friendly. Our web application will allow users to share their flashcard decks with one another more efficiently (horizontal integration), and allow the “best” flash-cards to be entered into a central database (vertical integration). The users (students of UCI Medical School) will upload flashcards they have made themselves onto the central database into many shared deck based on subject. Users will then be able to view all of the cards within the shared decks. 

Users will also be able to vote on which flash cards are the most useful and have the best definitions. Students will be able to edit cards, and then the edits will be approved by selected moderators. We will be creating an algorithm to sort cards based on the votes for and against the cards, deleting cards with a low enough voting score.

## Why we are building it

Building a website to compliment the Anki flashcard mobile application will create a more connected learning community within the UCI Medical School students and will improve the application’s user experience.

The Anki desktop application allows users to create personal decks and share them with other Anki users via import and export. The deck sharing feature requires users to manually import and export each flashcard deck from the AnkiWeb to use and edit other’s decks, putting users off from using the sharing feature. Anki flashcard decks are mainly individual, and this causes current students to do a lot of redundant work. If they were all able to add and edit to a shared deck they could spend more time on studying the best definitions, and making cards better, rather than spending time to just make the cards.

UCI Medical School wants to create a community for the students and improving the sharing feature will allow this. By building out these sharing capabilities into another website, we are able to control who has access to the decks (only UCI Medical School Students) so as to keep UCI a competitive school while creating a community learning experience.
